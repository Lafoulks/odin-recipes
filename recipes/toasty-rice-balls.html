        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash rice in a strainer. Cook in a rice cooker or pot. Wait until rice is cool enough to handle but still warm.</li>
            <li>Prepare a bowl of cold water. Periodically keep your hands wet with this water to prevent the rice from sticking to your hands.</li>
            <li>Take 1/2 of the cooked rice in hand. To add filling, flatten rice until it is about 1/2 inch thick and add filling to center. Fold
                rice in half so filling is hidden.
            </li>
            <li>Mould rice into a sof triangular shape with your palms.</li>
            <li>Add a piece of nori to the bottom of the triangle as shown in photo.</li>
            <li>Repeat until you are out of rice and enjoy!</li>
