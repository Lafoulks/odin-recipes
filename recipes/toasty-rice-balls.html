    <h3 class="rice">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="rice">
            <li>1/2 Cup of Uncooked Sushi Rice</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li> Desired Filling, such as cooked salmon, mayo, shrimp, etc</li>
            <li>2 Pieces of 1x5 inch nori</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="rice">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="rice">
            <li>Wash rice in a strainer. Cook in a rice cooker or pot. Wait until rice is cool enough to handle but still warm.</li>
            <li>Prepare a bowl of cold water. Periodically keep your hands wet with this water to prevent the rice from sticking to your hands.</li>
            <li>Take 1/2 of the cooked rice in hand. To add filling, flatten rice until it is about 1/2 inch thick and add filling to center. Fold
                rice in half so filling is hidden.
            </li>
            <li>Mould rice into a sof triangular shape with your palms.</li>
            <li>Add a piece of nori to the bottom of the triangle as shown in photo.</li>
            <li>Repeat until you are out of rice and enjoy!</li>
